## How To Contribute 

You will have to use some basic git commands for basic contributions in any opensource projects !

First you need to clone whole repo by 

```md
git clone
``` 

Then you have to make desired changes in the repository,
after making the changes you will have to add upstream to main repository 

```md
git remote add upstream
```

Now you have to make your own new branch

```md
git checkout -b branch-name
```

If you want to see the changes you made you can check with 

```md
git status
```

Now you will have to add the commits

```md
git add .
```
Now check the status if the changes are staged 

```md
git status
```

Now you will have to commit all the changes with message

```md
git commit -m "message"
``` 

Atlast you will have to push it with command

```md
git push origin branch-name
```
