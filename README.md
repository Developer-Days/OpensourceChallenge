You will have to use some basic git commands for basic contributions in any opensource projects !

First you need to clone whole repo by 

``git clone`` 

Then you have to make desired changes in the repository,
after making the changes you will havve to add upstream to main repository by cloning

`git remote add upstream`

Now you have to make your own new branch

`git checkout -b branch-name`

If you want to see the changes you made you can check with 

`git status`
