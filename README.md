## How To Contribute
You will have to use some basic git commands for basic contributions in any opensource projects !

First you need to clone whole repo by 

``git clone`` 

Then you have to make desired changes in the repository,
after making the changes you will have to add upstream to main repository 

`git remote add upstream`

Now you have to make your own new branch

`git checkout -b branch-name`

If you want to see the changes you made you can check with 

`git status`

Now you will have to add the commits

`git add .`

Now check the status if the changes are staged 

`git status`

Now you will have to commit all the changes with message

`git commit -m "message"` 

Atlast you will have to push it with command

`git push origin lang-code`
